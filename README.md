# Event-Based Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing event-based datasets to identify patterns, trends, and insights using Python. The objective of the project is to clean, explore, and visualize structured data in order to support analytical understanding and reporting.

The analysis was carried out as part of an academic and skill-development initiative.

## Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on event datasets
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns
- Visualize key findings using charts and graphs
- Summarize insights in a clear and structured manner

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4. Data visualization
5. Interpretation of results

## Key Insights
- Identified patterns and variations across different events
- Observed trends based on time and event categories
- Visualized comparisons to support analytical understanding

## Conclusion
This project helped strengthen my understanding of data analysis concepts, data visualization techniques, and structured analytical thinking using Python.
